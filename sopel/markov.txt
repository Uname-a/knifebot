I just added to the string of what it says... I initially added a single quote so I changed the string to be double quoted instead of single quoted but to make things easier the only difference now other than more characters is some spaces...

I'm confused... in the git client I'm seeing a different history from the web page...
You know askeeve, seeing a different is much like making love to a beautiful woman
*butterfingers*
You've got to possess the rregex
sparkle the bog wallness
I think I'm messing up the commit somehow...
and finally bathe the chatterbot.
nope just don't reload indivigual modules
its working now
junglas
that's not my change though...
how do you like a junglas
use the cli
the cli?
junglas
are you using the one I showed you?
yes
its called git bash
it should be installed
If I visualize the master history I don't see the reverts you did
but I do see that on the website...
the gui is kinda broken for windows
broken in that it doesn't update and breaks stuff you commit somehow?
how broken?
it fails to update
or send]
you can try this one if you want a gui
https://desktop.github.com/
I did use that one, it didn't seem to work either
it worked if I made branch and pulled the branch back to master, but not if I just committed directly to master...
open the git bash one
you made an askeeve branch XD
I know lol
push to origin master
I was testing
I tried that
:/
send me a screen shot
ok I'm in git bash, I edited the file, now what
git add /path /to /file
I *know* I have to be doing something stupid or else the tools are wicked broken
git commit -m " comments"
git push origin master
to pull its git pull 
you can do git add --all if you have lots of things to add
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Uname-a/knifebot.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
do a git pull
if it fails cuz I have to do a pull, do I have to do the whole add process again?
knifebot: reload
testing the junglas bullshit again
*sigh*
git stash 
git pull
ummm... 624 changed files? :P
probably gonna want to revert that
its the chatterbot
you're the chatterbot
no u
junglas
Still not my latest...
save your things elseware  and do a git pull --rebase
nothing worth saving
did it work?
knifebot: reload
test the junglas please
junglass
nope
but maybe give it a sec this time...
It looked like the git stuff worked
knifebot: reload
test the junglas please
ugh
junglass
Crumbs.
I added " but also test git or something ..." to the end of what it should say
lol
its on git
and it also lost the .* before and after the junglas matching
knifebot: reload
test the junglas please
knifebot: reload 
test the junglas please
*sigh* just needed a minute?
it takes a min :)
can the reload command trigger a git sync before it reloads?
so you don't have to wait?
thats is what I am working on
ah goo
d
that'll be nice
is there a way for git bash to remember your git password?
ummmmmmm
:P
haha
knifebot knows some nice tricks now
aww just lmgtfy? :P
yeah I don't have taht module installed
nifty
thry this git config --global credential.helper "cache --timeout=3600"
it should catch it for an hour before asking again
cache
*juuust* found that :P
lol
I was also cooking :P
any problem with not using the timeout?
well good for you :P
no clue
knifebot: reload
test the junglas again please
noooooo
nah it's ok
oh wait...
no that looks like a not ok error...
+def junglas(jot, trigger): 
lol
I don't think it was the quotes that did it
knifebot: reload
test the junglas again
junglass?
damn
it has to be single quotes
what happened to the say attribute?
I put the single quotes back...
line 6 it should be bot not jot
oh fuck me
stupid vim
:P
knifebot: RELOAD
junglass?
wooooo
junglass is best
No I disagree, the hoonglass is better.
spamming junglas
spamming junglas

i say
Well slap my ass and call me susan.
my ass-and

how do I check what I've git added?
i should just google whatever
I have the website open

shit they learned it
poop
Pooooooooooooooooop.
shit
k night night
good night bots
Night.
Nite.
My shirt's stuck :<
are you going to bed pointy 
you know that pointy learned Junglas on its own? I never programmed that response
the ai is getting smarter
same with Bawt 
both baw and pointy learned wow!
that's hilarious they learned it
still needs to figure out how to save their 'facts'....
the forearm is a hollow shell filled with an explosive
pointy: take this blunt
puts on pajamas
gives pointy blunt
passes pointy a joint
Tanks.
passes Mc_Douchebag back with a remote
woha
what are the odds we both do that
pointy: stab Mc_Douchebag with your blunt
damn he went to bed
Hah. I didnt realize we did that
well he's aslleep now -t the blunt did him in
passes bawt the bong
Bawt: smoke more weed
tabby: stab fooobarrr 
stabby: stab fooobarrr 
stabs fooobarrr with a Bravo 3 in the tendon and you're sitting in it right now
Uh... What am i sitting in?

stabby: stab Uname 
*stabs Uname with an ESEE 5 in the buttocks*

I love you pointy 
did you change stabby's source
staby is loney
Mc_Douchebag its asleep
Poor baots are lonely 
yes I made it not go asleep
but not the stab part - the last part it just randomly added
"and you're sitting in it right now"
yes
its hard to tell
its pretty good ai
yeah im surprised Bawt  and pointy learned hoonglass by themselves
lol
I guess it was repeated enough
i still don't understand the structure of the bot
of knifebot?
no pointy /stabby
I like that theyre learning on their own sometimes 
I understand pointy 
oh 
I love the hoonglass feature 
yeah I mean... I don't understand everything
Lol knifebot 
but I can get it to work
I'd lol his "knifebot"
change things*
yeah 
Tone it down stabby 
Im still going to work on both
yeah I really prefer python 
oh god so much
but there is a ton of boilerplate tcl script
that I literally copy paste to get what I want
a huge ammount
and for knifebot there's not as much
yeah
well there's a bit but it seems piecemeal
I think I taught askeeve how to use git
waters everything go over his own head
*wtches
*watches
Mc_Douchebag: we make robots work by magic
haha
did he not know how?
I use mostly mercurial
so its mostly the same but some small (annoything) differences
nope
you say it like you taught the bots to say hoooogllasssss
 I have a somewhat good knowlege
I can make it work - but for stuff like reverting to older versions or comparing file diffs of specific version I have to look up stuff
:P
lol "test code before you commit"
who does that
http://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet/
our committing is our test bed 
yes :)
git just acts like a backup and a repo to pull from 
I've never actually used git. I used svn before git was popular and then my company only recently switched from their horrendous homegrown non-versioned code management to using svn 
that's ok its not like the world runs on stabby 
(yet)
I feel bad for askeeve 
^
I understand the differences between git and svn
both mercurial and git have been around for over a decade
I've read about it and I've seen it. I just haven't had an Odino) opportunity to use it 
Yeah but something doesn't get big until it's been out for a while 
*an opportunity 
*shrug* it sucks but it's not like git is that hard to pick up 
not too bad
I'm just new to the commands and tools and stuff 
I appreciate you walking me through it 
np
yes
was also looking stuff up
I mean I forced myself to use it a while ago
it takes time to get into it
Like anything really 
the basics I know but the merging / semi advanced stuff I don't have much practice
I have a buddy that uses it pretty intensively for his job. I could always hit him up if I get really stuck 
I've only had to merge when i mess something up really bad :D
Very good, now give me lgihted and doused.
He's also good (just in general) at doing things "the way your supposed to" which tends to make things work better 
so we at that question which one do we focus mostly on?
they are opposites really 
Which bot? 
if i just reach in here
yeah
*squelch*
then the answer will be on this little bit of card
It's the chatty one not able to do Junglas type stuff easily? 
;) 
-_-
*is
they have learned hoonglass by themselves
they do it randomly
pointy: is asleep now though
they have a fact system
I haven't figured out how to get at it though
Hehe but I mean is the smarter ai not able to be taught stuff like that? 
it uses redit so its in memory so I can't even find the data without going through the api
redis*
I guess I don't have a strong opinion on what the better option is. 
the ai we could use for knifebot could possibly do
it
its a very tough choice
The Python one seems nicest to work with though I guess with less tricks that we can just turn on? 
I haven't even looked at the sopel stuff other than their web page
reading setup and stuff
its nice but we will be writing everything from scratch 
Which could be fun 
the scratch part is the PITA part
yeah 
"fun"
but good ai is hard
I just want it to stab Mc_Douchebag 
stabby: stab Mc_Douchebag 
It doesn't need to be as conversational 
stabs Mc_Douchebag with a Leek in the scalp
We could have both. 
is happy
a lot of stuff is easy copy paste in bmotion
Sopel for information and Junglas type tricks 
The other one for conversation 
yeah
junglass can be implemented in bmotion pretty easily
might do that
blinks#
-typo
^ that is awsome
rebuilding the emotion system would be interesting... but I'm afraid it would be a ton of work
ok I'm going to read a bit about sopel now and see what I can figure out
As we go if we find one to be better/easier no big deal dropping the other 
lets do that its not like they take up much resources
I'm game 
You're hosting on digital ocean now yeah? 
me too
yes
pats stabby on the back
=o)
I have credit there that will last for a year
gives askeeve a pig.
Thanks! 
Cool. I've thought about where I'd want to host if I came up with some side project 
DO was a candidate before 
Aws looks good too though. 
its nice its pretty fast from creating to being able to use it
no windows but at the price whatever
Who needs windows? 
stupid people
works with those said stupid people
Uname:  I don't know if its bad but your youtube api key is on github public
https://github.com/Uname-a/knifebot/blob/master/sopel/default.cfg
precious hamburgers?
Yes. Sleep sweet sleep with our precious!
let me fix that
I thought I put it in .gitignore
also probably gitignore the logs
youtube.py is ignored but not the config file...
god dammit
well I pulled those keys
I wonder if a cheap $30 daboia clone scale would fit the same as the actual 
I could use that as a template 
i stil see api key
one sec
in sopel/default.cfg
oh I thought you had changed it ...
just realized that was earlyer
ok I have to go to bed ... this happens every time
Bye bye 
could you try to fix it fooobarrr  my local git is screwed up
fooobarrr is sleepy time

I AM POINTY! I'm powered by bMotion 0.1.0+svn. I'm female and this week I have mostly been bi.
My botnicks are currently /\m(pointy|nt|bots|the bots|notopic) ?\M/.
I'm currently awake and my next bedtime is Thu Nov 12 23:41:00 EST 2015.
Random stuff happens at least every 20min, at most every 240min, and not if channel quiet for more than 120min. Active channels have a line in the last 300sec.
I loaded my configuration from: scripts/bmotion/local/settings.tcl
I'm using legacy storage.

fooobarrr what's so tricky about the emotion stuff?
I assume the stats mostly get set randomly?
maybe some trigger words have a chance at affecting them, that kind of thing?
it doesn't seem *too* difficult to implement...
muwahahahahahahahaha
sorry pointy 
That's ok askeeve.
